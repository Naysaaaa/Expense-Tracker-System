# Expense-Tracker-System
This project focuses on creating a user-friendly Expense Management System that helps
users record and analyze their expenses efficiently. The system is built using Python with a
graphical user interface (GUI) developed in Tkinter, and uses a MySQL database for backend
storage. Users can perform operations like adding, updating, and deleting expense records,
categorizing expenses, and exporting expense reports to CSV for further analysis.
Additionally, the project includes a machine learning module using regression to analyze
historical expense data and predict future expenses.The application promotes better budgeting and transparency in expense tracking, making it suitable for students and
individuals aiming to manage daily expenditures.
